# ProvenanceCode™ Trademark Policy

**ProvenanceCode™** is a trademark of **KDDLC AI Solutions SL**.

This document outlines the proper use of the ProvenanceCode trademark.

## Purpose of the Trademark

The ProvenanceCode trademark serves to:

1. **Protect users** - Ensure they can identify authentic implementations
2. **Maintain quality** - Prevent misleading or non-compliant uses
3. **Preserve brand** - Build recognition and trust in the ecosystem
4. **Enable commerce** - Allow KDDLC AI Solutions SL to operate commercially

## Trademark vs License

**Important distinction:**

- **The Standard Specification** is licensed under **Apache 2.0** (open and free)
- **The "ProvenanceCode" name** is a **trademark** (protected)

You can implement the standard freely under Apache 2.0.
You can also use the ProvenanceCode name with some guidelines.

## Permitted Uses

You **MAY** use "ProvenanceCode" without permission to:

### ✅ Reference the Standard

```
"This tool implements the ProvenanceCode standard"
"Compliant with ProvenanceCode v1.0"
"Based on ProvenanceCode specification"
```

### ✅ Describe Compatibility

```
"ProvenanceCode-compatible validator"
"Supports ProvenanceCode DEO format"
"Reads ProvenanceCode decision files"
```

### ✅ Educational Use

```
"Introduction to ProvenanceCode"
"ProvenanceCode tutorial"
"Understanding ProvenanceCode decisions"
```

### ✅ Descriptive Use

```
"ProvenanceCode validator for GitLab"
"Community ProvenanceCode implementation"
```

## Restricted Uses

You **MUST NOT** use "ProvenanceCode" to:

### ❌ Imply Official Status

```
❌ "Official ProvenanceCode tool" (unless authorized)
❌ "ProvenanceCode by [Your Company]" (implies endorsement)
❌ "Certified by ProvenanceCode" (without certification)
```

### ❌ Create Confusion

```
❌ Using ProvenanceCode as your product name alone
❌ Claiming your implementation IS ProvenanceCode
❌ Suggesting official affiliation without authorization
```

### ❌ Trademark Variations

```
❌ "ProvCode" as a trademark
❌ "PC Standard" as abbreviation in branding
❌ Modified logos or marks
```

## Naming Your Implementation

### Good Examples

- **GitLab ProvenanceCode Validator** - Clear what it is, what it does
- **ProvenanceCode Tools for Jenkins** - Descriptive, not confusing
- **Community ProvenanceCode CLI** - Clear it's community-built
- **[YourProduct] with ProvenanceCode support** - Your brand + compatibility

### Bad Examples

- ❌ **ProvenanceCode Enterprise** - Sounds official
- ❌ **ProvenanceCode++** - Creates confusion
- ❌ **The ProvenanceCode Platform** - Implies you own it
- ❌ **Official ProvenanceCode** - Misleading

## Logo and Visual Identity

### Current Status

No official logo currently exists. When one is created, separate logo usage guidelines will be published.

### Wordmark Usage

When using "ProvenanceCode" in text:
- First use in documentation: **ProvenanceCode™**
- Subsequent uses: ProvenanceCode (no ™ required)
- Always capitalize both words: "ProvenanceCode" not "provenancecode"

## Apache 2.0 + Trademark Coexistence

This is a common pattern (also used by Apache™, Kubernetes®, etc.):

**Standard/Code:**
- Licensed under Apache 2.0
- Free to use, modify, distribute
- Open source, permissive

**Name/Brand:**
- Protected trademark
- Guidelines for usage
- Prevents confusion and misuse

**Both can coexist** - you get open technology + brand protection.

## Certification Program (Future)

EmbankAI (KDDLC AI Solutions SL) may offer an optional certification program:

- **"ProvenanceCode Certified Implementation"** badge
- Requires compliance testing
- Voluntary participation
- Separate terms for certified mark usage

Details TBD when program launches.

## Commercial Use

You **MAY** build commercial products that implement ProvenanceCode:

- ✅ SaaS services
- ✅ Proprietary implementations
- ✅ Consulting services
- ✅ Enterprise support offerings

You **MUST** follow trademark guidelines when naming and marketing these products.

## Enforcement

EmbankAI (KDDLC AI Solutions SL) reserves the right to:

- Request changes to misleading uses
- Pursue legal action for serious infringement
- Revoke permission for guideline violations

**Our philosophy:** We want to enable the ecosystem, not stifle it. These guidelines protect users and the brand while allowing maximum freedom for implementations.

If you're unsure about a use case, ask us first.
