# ProvenanceCode Governance Bundle v1

Follow these rules during Cursor agent work:

1. Generate `GEN-*` artifacts for meaningful changes in `.provenance/events/`.
2. For risk-triggered changes (`auth/**`, `security/**`, `infra/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `.provenance/config/**`), include or link a valid `DEC-*` artifact.
3. Keep provenance capture hash-based by default. Do not store raw prompt contents or secrets in artifacts.
4. Ensure artifacts validate with:
   - `./.provenance/bin/prvc validate`
5. Keep enforcement deterministic:
   - Hook automation is best-effort local.
   - CI check is the merge-blocking authority.
